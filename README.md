# CrossCode_JSON_Editor
This is a python script to modify the JSON files for the game CrossCode.

As of the initial commit, all it can do is make the drop rates of the enemies and inanimate objects 100% and remove the rank requirement.

Future plans are to make the script more modular and work as a command line tool / potentially a gui.
- user input drop rates
- user input item drops
- user input credits / exp drops
- enemy size
- enemy AI
- shops
- quests
- etc.
